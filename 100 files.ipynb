    "There is one case involved in this proceeding. It is a specific injury of January 20, 2014.\n",
    "Defendant Conagra Foods filed a timely and verified Petition for Reconsideration on December\n",
    "21, 2020.\n",
    "Defendant California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA) filed an Answer to Petition\n",
    "for Reconsideration timely and verified on January 5, 2021.\n",
    "Defendant Conagra Foods seeks reconsideration on the grounds that the decision of the\n",
    "arbitrator does not justify the Findings of Fact and the Findings of Fact do not support the Findings\n",
    "and Award. They also allege the arbitrator acted without or in excess of his powers.\n",
    "At the arbitration, the parties agreed that Conagra Foods was the special employer for the\n",
    "applicant. The applicant was performing duties under the supervision, control, and direction of the\n",
    "special employer Conagra Foods.\n",
    "Conagra, a self-insured employer contends they are not considered other insurance and that\n",
    "is the reason why the arbitration decision should be overturned.\n",
    "CIGA in their Answer to Petition for Reconsideration stated Conagra is other insurance\n",
    "within the meaning of insurance Code Section 1063.lc (9) and that CIGA has no liability in this\n",
    "matter.\n",
    "STATEMENT OF FACTS\n",
    "Defendant Conagra foods has filed a timely and verified Petition for Reconsideration on\n",
    "December 21, 2020.\n",
    "Defendant CIGA filed a timely and verified Answer to Petition for Reconsideration on\n",
    "January 5, 2021.\n",
    "This case involves a specific injury on January 20, 2014.\n",
    "The sole issue is coverage.\n",
    "Pursuant to agreement at the arbitration Conagra Foods was the special employer for the\n",
    "applicant on the date of injury.\n",
    "Conagra contends there is no mechanism for a self-insured employer to obtain an\n",
    "endorsement from the insurance commissioner excluding employees working at Conagra as a\n",
    "special employer.\n",
    "4\n",
    "CIGA contends there is joint and several liability between the special employer Conagra\n",
    "and the general employer CIGA. CIGA contends that self-insurance is other insurance within the\n",
    "meaning of Insurance Code Section 1063.1©(9). Therefore, they allege they have no liability for\n",
    "this claim as CIGA is not in fact an insurance company and if there is other insurance the claims\n",
    "administration and coverage liability would be placed upon Conagra the special employer.\n",
    "DISCUSSION\n",
    "Conagra in their Petition for Reconsideration states they have fully complied with the laws\n",
    "related to self-insurance which limit coverage to its own employees and excludes coverage for\n",
    "employees of other companies. They admit they were not able to obtain an exclusionary\n",
    "endorsement which would have denied coverage where they were found to be the special\n",
    "employer.\n",
    "Conagra admits there is no mechanism for a self-insured employer to obtain an\n",
    "endorsement from the insurance commissioner excluding employees working at Conagra as a\n",
    "special employer.\n",
    "For matters of coverage there is no distinction between a private insurance company and a\n",
    "self-insured employer. Both are state mandated policies to cover all California workers with\n",
    "workers compensation insurance.\n",
    "Conagra Foods did not have an exclusionary policy form filed with the state which would\n",
    "exclude any temporary staffing employees who worked at Conagra.\n",
    "Due to the fact there is admitted special employment CIGA was relieved of the\n",
    "responsibility for coverage as there is other insurance under Insurance Code Section 1063.10 (9).\n",
    "RECOMMENDATION\n",
    "For the reasons stated above, it is recommended the Petition for Reconsideration dated\n",
    "December 21, 2020 be denied.\n",
